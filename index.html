        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="bio">
          <p>
            My writing journey started in 2014, when I first discovered my
            fascination with the art of literary composition in a kindergarten
            class, with a story on cheese crackers and planes as my primus opus.
            I attended several other classes on rhetoric, studying its lost
            tools, identifying certain points of controversy in literature, and
            creating persuasive arguments on said points, such as the heated
            debate over whether Digory and Polly were morally correct to have
            left the guinea pig in the Woods Between the Worlds. This was
            followed by my first (and to date, last) fiction novella, and a
            growing yearning to hone my skills of transcribing the stories in my
            imagination to physical ink and paper. Enter: Excelsior Classes and
            the illustrious Mrs. Woods.

          <h3>Glass Beneath the Sky – Memoir Poem</h3>
          <p class="piece-meta">August 26, 2025 | 314 words</p>
          <p>
            The pure beauty of that moment; the way the sun beams danced upon
            the waves,<br />
            Scattering fractals of light that shone deep into my very being,
            lighting the dark.<br />
            The silence surrounding me was an impenetrable barrier,<br />
            None of the insecurities or worries I had felt that morning could
            permeate my mind;<br />
            My own thoughts were clear as glass, yet nothing could seep
            through.<br />
            <br />
            Only the quiet calm of the moment.<br />
            <br />
            The cool breath of dawn slid into me, crisp and clear as the lake’s
            reflection.<br />
            Everything else, everything from the real world all just
            disappeared<br />
            Like driftwood beneath Tahoe’s unperturbed surface,<br />
            Its deep blue mirroring the cloudless heavens above.<br />
            As I sat there, enjoying the peace of the moment, I saw two birds,
            blue jays,<br />
            Flitting about the pines above my head. Their coats mirrored the
            lake,<br />
            As if they were extensions of the placid water brought to life.<br />
            Their calls filled the air, shattering the silence I had enjoyed
            that morning.<br />
            And yet, their raucous warbling seemed to only add to the peace of
            the moment,<br />
            Their life and energy a stark contrast to the tranquility of the
            lake.<br />
            And in that moment, I realized a fact that should have come to me
            long ago.<br />
            The serenity of the lake in contrast to the trilling of the jays
            were in perfect harmony.<br />
            Not in the musical sense of the term (their strident songs were
            anything but melodic),<br />
            But in the sense of balance. Newton’s Third law of motion does not
            simply pertain to movement,<br />
            But to life in general. Every creation that God has made has an
            equal and opposite counterpart in life,<br />
            Balancing the food chain, environment, ecosystem, and even the
            world.<br />
            As I stared into the lake, still as glass beneath the sky, I
            pondered these things,<br />
            And I still think about them today.

              <strong>Reflection:</strong> This was my first piece of literature
              that I wrote in this class. It helped me explore my voice and
              experiment with imagery and metaphor, and blank verse truly allowed me to
              expand upon my creative expression through my integration of
              visual elements. It was also my personal favorite to write, as I
              was simply able to close my eyes and let the description of the
              scene dance to life on the page.

          <h3>The Mask and the Mirror – Literary Narrative</h3>
          <p class="piece-meta">September 16, 2025 | 610 words</p>
          <p>
            Humor has always been a default for me. It has been my way of
            connecting with others, creating bonds of friendship, and other such
            social experiences. I wouldn’t necessarily describe myself as the
            class clown in my friend group, but I’ve always been one of the most
            frisky. It was how I could stick out, and yet fit in with my
            friends. It was my most pro:minent detail, my modus operandi. My
            humor and quick pivots were common instruments in my toolbox used to
            build connections. I would always try to look on the bright side of
            things, and if there was none, I would make it myself. My boundless
            optimism would radiate like rays from the sun, touching everything
            and everyone around me. A veritable truth to my friends, but a mask
            to myself. I never spoke about my own anxieties, emotions, or
            personal life. Those facts seemed inconsequential, and I wasn’t
            willing to bog down my friends with my own issues. So I kept them
            hidden under my guise of comedy, as an actor wearing a Greek Thalia
            mask hides their own face. When someone would ask me how I was
            doing, I would concoct a witty reply to draw even the faintest smile
            out of them while avoiding the true purpose of their question. The
            placidity of my jocular demeanor was simply a tool with which I
            could brighten the days of those around me, keeping the raging
            tempest of my life tucked away within the folds of my mind.<br /><br />
            Then it happened. <br /><br />
            It was a mundane afternoon at a park nearby my home. My friends and
            I were, as per usual, playing a round of Ultimate Frisbee. The smell
            of freshly cut grass filled the air, heavy with the humidity of an
            incoming squall as we romped beneath the sky, obscured by a veil of
            dark clouds, layered upon one another as a woven blanket of
            storm-threaded fog. Despite the foreboding weather, we launched
            ourselves at the game as though it were a normal summer’s day.
            Gradually, the skies began to open, rain seeping through the
            heavens, putting an end to our match. <br />As we sought refuge
            beneath the park pavilion, something stirred within me. I had not
            been feeling like myself that day, at least, the witty image I
            projected to my acquaintances. Though I’m not sure exactly what
            caused it, I have a hunch that the ongoing deluge from the heavens
            may have put a mirror to the internal commotion I withheld. It was
            as though the rain of that day was acidic, burning through my mask
            and letting my suppressed self bubble to the surface. I started to
            truly ponder the difference between the ‘me’ I lived with and the
            ‘me’ my friends saw, like looking into a fractured mirror, deciding
            which shard to trust. That changed me. For better or worse, I don’t
            know. But it gave me honesty. My friends noticed the change almost
            immediately. Naturally, they were concerned with the change of my
            natural demeanor. I knew that it would take time to make them
            understand the real Evan behind the mask of humor I used, this
            unfamiliar character that was the real me. But my real friends, the
            ones who liked me for who I was, didn’t care. They accepted me.
            Sure, I wasn’t going to always be as light and peppy as I once was,
            but that just added a new layer of myself for them to know. A new
            layer for myself to explore, instead of suppressing.

              <strong>Reflection:</strong> This piece allowed me to blend
              personal reflection with literary analysis. It shows my growing
              confidence with narrative voice and imagery. I primarily focused
              on developing a strong central metaphor (the mask and mirror) to
              unify the essay, while also experimenting with varied sentence
              structures. The one thing I would improve upon here is tightening
              some of the paragraphs for better flow.

          <h3>No Fanfare, just Freedom – Reflective Paper</h3>
          <p class="piece-meta">November 12, 2025 | 730 words</p>
          <p>
            2020 was certainly a… memorable year. The start of a new decade, the
            change in presidency, and the global outbreak of a pandemic. In May,
            I had just turned ten years old, and despite the newly enforced
            quarantine, scratchy masks, and the disinfection station we had set
            up in our garage for groceries, my spirit remained undampened. For
            all my young, unburdened mind cared, my life was starting to look up
            as I entered my tween years. I had recently given my life to Christ,
            and nothing was able to take that joy away from me, especially as I
            waited in anticipation for a major event in my life: my baptism in
            June. As we drove to my church, I couldn’t stop thinking about how
            exciting it all would be! My family and friends all around, cheering
            loudly for me, as I become completely changed! It was almost too
            much for me to handle. As we entered the parking lot, I was
            ecstatic, struggling to resist my excitement and the urge to jump
            out of the car and rush through the flash flood of rain to the
            church right then and there. Unbeknownst to me, covid was going to
            have more of an impact on my baptism than I had originally
            believed.<br />
            After what seemed an eternity of sitting in the car with my parents,
            our church’s main pastor walked up to our car to lead us inside. We
            put on our masks, exited our vehicle, and followed him into the
            church. I was dumbfounded. I had never seen a building of community
            and fellowship in the Lord look so… abandoned. The air was thin and
            cold, completely devoid of the cheerful voices that had filled it
            just six months ago. Our footsteps echoed throughout the empty halls
            as we approached the baptismal pool that had been set up in the
            lobby. The portable pool was small, smelling slightly of chlorine,
            and the water was surprisingly cold against my skin, a stark
            contrast to the warmth I had imagined. I was led into it, and my
            pastor submerged me. As I came out of the water, my ten-year-old
            mind expected some sort of musical fanfare, perhaps some balloons to
            fall from the heavens. But the only thing I heard was the clapping
            of my parents and the dripping of water as my pastor smiled and
            congratulated me. If I’m being honest, I was a little bit
            underwhelmed. Where was all of the raucous celebration I had dreamed
            of? I was expecting something grand, theatrical even. And that’s
            when things started to change.<br />
            After I left the pool and dried off the water still clinging to me,
            I was met with my parent’s crushing embrace. My dad is a tough guy,
            with even-keel feelings, Mr. Emotional Stability. But when he pulled
            back from me, he was choked up, and his eyes were wet with tears of
            joy. I stayed there with my parents for a few hours, watching others
            be baptized, celebrating them with the growing throng of masked
            multitudes. As I watched, face after face emerged from the water,
            transforming from tired and worn expressions to ones of pure ecstasy
            and joy, beaming with broad smiles at the pastor and the still
            multiplying crowd. And it was then that I really felt something. A
            profound peace that I had never come close to experiencing before.
            When we finally returned home, I entered my room, eagerly flipping
            through my bible to re-read a passage we had been shown during the
            pre-baptismal meeting. My gaze landed on the verse, and I smiled. I
            retraced the sentence with my eyes time after time, finally gaining
            comprehension of Romans 6:4b. “Just as Christ was raised from the
            dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
            <br />
            Sure, my fantastical expectations had still not been fulfilled, and
            Covid had taken any hope of expansive cheering away from this
            occasion. But somehow, it felt even more peaceful without an
            abundance of spectators. The relative silence seemed to strip away
            the theatrical performance I had wished for, leaving only the pure
            transformation of that day. My new life had truly begun, a clean
            slate, free from any burden I held before. And that feeling of
            freedom? It was worth more than any balloons could ever give me.

           Night was falling as the stormy-eyed cat trudged down the alleyway. He didn't know what he was doing there, or where he was going, but some instinct inside him told him to keep walking. As he rounded a corner, he was suddenly blinded by a brilliant light. From somewhere inside, he heard a deep rich voice call his name: "Lyric." The light began to quickly grow, engulfing everything in sight, including the petrified cat.<br><br>

	Lyric woke with a start, hitting his head on the roof of the wooden crate he lived in. As he rubbed his head, he wondered what in the world that dream meant. This was not the first strange dream that Lyric had this week, but the first with a spoken word. The other four dreams had just been blurry visions of colors, sometimes with a woman's voice singing in the background. Lyric started to fall asleep again, attempting to bring back a clearer dream to try to decipher what these meant when suddenly, his sensitive nose was filled with a familiar stench. He silently crept out of his crate to see if his nose was correct. "Palace guards!?" Lyric whispered anxiously. Eight royal soldiers were patrolling the streets in formation."That's odd, those snobs usually stay at the castle." Lyric was observing the guard in the front of the group when suddenly, the rhino turned his gaze directly at Lyric. He turned, said something to the others, and started lumbering over to the cat. Lyric's heart started beating as fast as a mouse's. "Fish nibblets," Lyric squeaked in fear. Noticing a small hole in the corner of his home, He sneakily slipped out of the crate, and out of the alleyway. As he paced the side of the road, he realized that the guard had somehow seen him, and was now following Lyric. Lowering his cap, Lyric started a quick jog. Sure enough, the rhino matched his pace and started catching up. Lyric quickly turned into another alley and ducked behind a flower cart. He tried to stifle the sound of his breathing, but he could do nothing of the raucous sound of his pounding heart. Lyric pricked up his ears, listening as the guard stopped at the entrance of the alley, panting heavily. After a few minutes in his hiding spot, Lyric believed the guard to be gone and peeked around the edge of the cart. Suddenly, two heavy hands yanked Lyric out of his hiding spot. Lyric jerked his head up and stared into the face of the huge guard.<br><br>
"I haven't done anything wrong, I-I swear!" Lyric quickly whispered a correction, "Today." The guard stayed silent and looked the cat up and down. Lyric wasn't much to look at - a small black cat with a torn jacket, thin trousers, rags sewn together as a shirt, and a flat tan cap covering his eyes. The guard threw off the hat, and two frightened, grey, stormy eyes stared back at his. <br>
"Listen, whatever I did, I'm sure money would cover it," Lyric said, trying to talk his way out of this, "I mean, I'm sure I could give you money, you could let me go, It would be a win-win! None of your big friends would have to know that I paid you,-<br>
"Are you Lyric Dahkir?" The guard interrupted. Lyric stared at him, not knowing what to answer. As if on cue, the other 7 guards appeared at the entrance of the alley. <br>
"Yes," Lyric started, "I am. Now let me ask you a question: what do you want with me?" Instead of answering, another guard from the front of the alleyway lifted a nondescript cloth bag he carried. Before Lyric knew what was happening, he felt a blunt pain on the top of his head and slipped into unconsciousness.

              <strong>Reflection:</strong> This is an excerpt from my short story, a creative writing assignment
              where I developed a fantasy narrative. It showcases my ability to
              create engaging characters and settings. I focused on pacing and
              suspense to keep readers interested. In hindsight, I would've worked more on
              deepening character development for greater emotional impact.

          <h3>Literary Analysis – The Wind and the Willows</h3>
          <p class="piece-meta">Amicus Classical Academy | Literature / Composition | 2023</p>
          <p>
            Imagine that you are a young, affluent, reckless individual with a grandiose mansion, kind, caring, compassionate acquaintances, and a need for speed, unquenchable and roaring within you as a great fire does within a lush forest. You may also have a few kleptomaniac tendencies. One day you are peacefully eating lunch at your favorite restaurant when suddenly, a beautiful, sputtering, gleaming automobile parks right in front of a window next to you. As it is an old convertible, there is no security on the doors. If you had the chance to feel the adrenaline you so desperately needed at the extent of the owner of the car and the law, would you?<br>

	In the excellent, splendid, amusing work of literature, The Wind in the Willows, Mr. Toad is a young, rich amphibian who abuses his colossal blessings of wealth and power, squandering his resources on the latest trend that he believes he will finally find full fulfillment in. After his friends unsuccessfully attempt to cure Mr. Toad of his addiction to fast-fading frivolities, Mr. Toad finds himself at an inn, orders a delectable lunch, and sits down to eat. He seems to be presently cured of his ailment of dissatisfaction and envy and is peacefully enjoying his day, when suddenly, a great motorcar pulls up in the front of the inn, conveniently in his line of sight. Mr. Toad feels a great envy swelling up within him like a croak, and he must decide what he will do.<br>

	Everyone agrees that Mr. Toad is an aggressive, adrenaline-obsessed, aspiring automobilist who stole property that didn’t belong to him, but there is controversy over whether Mr. Toad should have listened to his desires and stolen the car, or listened to his better conscious, controlled himself, and simply been a normal toad, choosing not to commit this crime.<br>

	Mr. Toad should not have stolen the car for three reasons: The act was morally wrong, dangerous, and selfish.<br>

	Firstly, Mr. Toad should not have stolen the car because it was morally wrong. Stealing is an obvious sin, and from a very young age, we are all taught that committing the theft of an entire automobile is completely wrong and against the law. Toad also disregarded his friend’s warnings, disobeying Badger’s wise words to stay away from the speedy, metal, works of art that Toad so longed for. Mr. Toad additionally lost his family’s hard-earned fortune to numerous amounts in fines for motoring offenses, abusing all that was left to him.<br>

	Secondly, Mr. Toad should have exhibited self-control because the theft of the automobile was selfish. He did not stop himself to consider how his act of thoughtlessness would affect the owner of the car, nor the poor judge, who simply wanted a restful day, but was instead forced to hear the case of this terrible frog. He also didn’t give a second thought to the danger he was putting others in, due to his lack of driving experience. Toad also simply roamed the countryside, not thinking about the good this automobile could do for others, but simply about what it could do for him.<br>

	Thirdly, Mr. Toad should have refrained from committing this terrible crime because it was dangerous, not only to him but to others around him as well. Mr. Toad drove through miles of countryside, tearing up farmland and also putting countless lives in danger with his reckless driving. He also could have died when he crashed into the tree, ending the Toad bloodline as he did in the famous Disneyland attraction, Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride™.  Toad Hall was also endangered by Mr. Toad’s recklessness, for if he had taken any longer to return home, who knows what the Wild Wooders may have done to his home? Windows would be broken, ornate wallpapers ruined, and the entire estate may have fallen into disrepair, all because Toad couldn’t show an ounce of restraint.<br>

	Some may say that Toad’s lack of restraint was acceptable because Toad finally experienced the exhilaration that he was deprived of for so long. They might argue that Toad achieved his dream of speed, was able to take a ride in a luxurious, comfortable, high-tech car, and boosted his heart rate by running from the fuzz. However, this reasoning is faulty because Toad’s exhilaration was short-lived, and his joyride quickly turned into a ride in the back of a police vehicle.<br>
	Others might make the statement that Toad’s crime was permissible because Toad had a realization of his wrongdoing. They might back up this statement with the claims that Toad was repentant for his sin, he was aware that he had broken a law, and he accepted his fate and punishment. Yet these claims are simply not true, because Toad could have easily realized that stealing the car was wrong without committing the crime in the first place. Nor did Toad accept his fate, as he later enlisted the help of a gaoler’s daughter to escape the prison where he was held.<br>

	Neither of these claims, that Toad experienced exhilaration, nor that Toad had a realization of his crimes, are plausible, because Toad was punished for his act of recklessness and didn’t accept his fate.<br>

	In conclusion, Toad should not have stolen the automobile because the crime was not only morally wrong but also selfish and dangerous to others around him. This issue matters to those opposing the law, as it demonstrates that the pleasures that come with crime are fleeting like the wind.<br>

              <strong>Reflection:</strong> This literary analysis was written
              for a junior highschool literature class. It demonstrates my ability to
              construct a clear argument, use textual evidence, and analyze
              themes. I focused on logical structure and clarity. Looking back
              on this piece now, I would work more on varying sentence openings 
              for improved style.
