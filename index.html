        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="bio">
          <p>
            My writing journey started in 2014, when I first discovered my
            fascination with the art of literary composition in a kindergarten
            class, with a story on cheese crackers and planes as my primus opus.
            I attended several other classes on rhetoric, studying its lost
            tools, identifying certain points of controversy in literature, and
            creating persuasive arguments on said points, such as the heated
            debate over whether Digory and Polly were morally correct to have
            left the guinea pig in the Woods Between the Worlds. This was
            followed by my first (and to date, last) fiction novella, and a
            growing yearning to hone my skills of transcribing the stories in my
            imagination to physical ink and paper. Enter: Excelsior Classes and
            the illustrious Mrs. Woods.

          <h3>Glass Beneath the Sky – Memoir Poem</h3>
          <p class="piece-meta">August 20, 2025 | 314 words</p>
          <p>
            The pure beauty of that moment; the way the sun beams danced upon
            the waves,<br />
            Scattering fractals of light that shone deep into my very being,
            lighting the dark.<br />
            The silence surrounding me was an impenetrable barrier,<br />
            None of the insecurities or worries I had felt that morning could
            permeate my mind;<br />
            My own thoughts were clear as glass, yet nothing could seep
            through.<br />
            <br />
            Only the quiet calm of the moment.<br />
            <br />
            The cool breath of dawn slid into me, crisp and clear as the lake’s
            reflection.<br />
            Everything else, everything from the real world all just
            disappeared<br />
            Like driftwood beneath Tahoe’s unperturbed surface,<br />
            Its deep blue mirroring the cloudless heavens above.<br />
            As I sat there, enjoying the peace of the moment, I saw two birds,
            blue jays,<br />
            Flitting about the pines above my head. Their coats mirrored the
            lake,<br />
            As if they were extensions of the placid water brought to life.<br />
            Their calls filled the air, shattering the silence I had enjoyed
            that morning.<br />
            And yet, their raucous warbling seemed to only add to the peace of
            the moment,<br />
            Their life and energy a stark contrast to the tranquility of the
            lake.<br />
            And in that moment, I realized a fact that should have come to me
            long ago.<br />
            The serenity of the lake in contrast to the trilling of the jays
            were in perfect harmony.<br />
            Not in the musical sense of the term (their strident songs were
            anything but melodic),<br />
            But in the sense of balance. Newton’s Third law of motion does not
            simply pertain to movement,<br />
            But to life in general. Every creation that God has made has an
            equal and opposite counterpart in life,<br />
            Balancing the food chain, environment, ecosystem, and even the
            world.<br />
            As I stared into the lake, still as glass beneath the sky, I
            pondered these things,<br />
            And I still think about them today.

              <strong>Reflection:</strong> This was my first piece of literature
              that I wrote in this class. It helped me explore my voice and
              experiment with imagery and metaphor, and truly allowed me to
              expand upon my creative expression through my integration of
              visual elements. It was also my personal favorite to write, as I
              was simply able to close my eyes and let the description of the
              scene dance to life on the page.

          <h3>The Mask and the Mirror – Literary Narrative</h3>

          </p>
          <p>
            Humor has always been a default for me. It has been my way of
            connecting with others, creating bonds of friendship, and other such
            social experiences. I wouldn’t necessarily describe myself as the
            class clown in my friend group, but I’ve always been one of the most
            frisky. It was how I could stick out, and yet fit in with my
            friends. It was my most pro:minent detail, my modus operandi. My
            humor and quick pivots were common instruments in my toolbox used to
            build connections. I would always try to look on the bright side of
            things, and if there was none, I would make it myself. My boundless
            optimism would radiate like rays from the sun, touching everything
            and everyone around me. A veritable truth to my friends, but a mask
            to myself. I never spoke about my own anxieties, emotions, or
            personal life. Those facts seemed inconsequential, and I wasn’t
            willing to bog down my friends with my own issues. So I kept them
            hidden under my guise of comedy, as an actor wearing a Greek Thalia
            mask hides their own face. When someone would ask me how I was
            doing, I would concoct a witty reply to draw even the faintest smile
            out of them while avoiding the true purpose of their question. The
            placidity of my jocular demeanor was simply a tool with which I
            could brighten the days of those around me, keeping the raging
            tempest of my life tucked away within the folds of my mind.<br><br>
            Then it happened. <br><br>
             It was a mundane afternoon at a park nearby my home. My
            friends and I were, as per usual, playing a round of Ultimate
            Frisbee. The smell of freshly cut grass filled the air, heavy with
            the humidity of an incoming squall as we romped beneath the sky,
            obscured by a veil of dark clouds, layered upon one another as a
            woven blanket of storm-threaded fog. Despite the foreboding weather,
            we launched ourselves at the game as though it were a normal
            summer’s day. Gradually, the skies began to open, rain seeping
            through the heavens, putting an end to our match. As we sought
            refuge beneath the park pavilion, something stirred within me. I had
            not been feeling like myself that day, at least, the witty image I
            projected to my acquaintances. Though I’m not sure exactly what
            caused it, I have a hunch that the ongoing deluge from the heavens
            may have put a mirror to the internal commotion I withheld. It was
            as though the rain of that day was acidic, burning through my mask
            and letting my suppressed self bubble to the surface. I started to
            truly ponder the difference between the ‘me’ I lived with and the
            ‘me’ my friends saw, like looking into a fractured mirror, deciding
            which shard to trust. That changed me. For better or worse, I don’t
            know. But it gave me honesty. My friends noticed the change almost
            immediately. Naturally, they were concerned with the change of my
            natural demeanor. I knew that it would take time to make them
            understand the real Evan behind the mask of humor I used, this
            unfamiliar character that was the real me. But my real friends, the
            ones who liked me for who I was, didn’t care. They accepted me.
            Sure, I wasn’t going to always be as light and peppy as I once was,
            but that just added a new layer of myself for them to know. A new
            layer for myself to explore, instead of suppressing.
